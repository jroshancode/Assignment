- What are the key features of Python?What are the different types of data types in Python?**

- What is the difference between a list and a tuple?
- What is a dictionary?
- What is a set?
- What is the difference between a deep copy and a shallow copy with examples?
- What are some of the most popular Python libraries?
- A shallow copy creates a new object but does not create copies of objects that the original object references. A deep copy, on the other hand, creates a new object and recursively adds copies of objects found in the original.
- What is the difference between == and is?
